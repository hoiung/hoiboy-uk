"""Wiring regression guard for the frontmatter gates in pre-publish.sh and ci.yml.

This wiring broke twice in blog-priv#55 and neither break was catchable by the
test suite, because every existing test exercises the Python validator and
nothing reads the shell script or the workflow that CALL it.

What broke, both times the same shape: `pre-publish.sh` gate 4 ran the validator
bare (whole tree) and gate 4a then re-ran `--scope consulting`, a strict subset.
That made gate 4a unable to fail when gate 4 passed, and `run_check` exits on the
first failure, so when a project page WAS broken gate 4 failed and gate 4a never
printed at all. The one case it existed for was the one case it could not reach.
`ci.yml` carried the identical nesting. The fix made the two scopes DISJOINT.

`scripts/test_validate_frontmatter.py` already proves the scopes are disjoint at
the module level. It cannot see how they are wired, so a revert to nested
scoping would leave the whole suite green. These tests close that gap.

They are deliberately source-scans rather than executions: running pre-publish.sh
means a full Hugo build plus live external-URL probing, which does not belong in
the unit tier. Same trade-off, and same rationale, as
tests/test_meet_recorder_content.py.
